# Install Docker on Ubuntu

Connect to your server with a `sudo` allowed account and run the following:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinyll/docker-install/master/install.sh | bash
```

This will very easily and quickly install Docker (community edition) and the Docker Compose plugin to your system.

You can then run `docker` and `docker compose` commands.

## Docker for Ubuntu

This is compatible for Ubuntu 22.04 (LTS) and very likely other versions.
